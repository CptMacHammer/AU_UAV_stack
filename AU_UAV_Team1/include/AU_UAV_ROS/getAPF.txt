getting APF to run




put AU_UAV_Team1 folder in AU_UAV_stack

add StartCollisionAvoidance.h, also in srv_gen/cpp/...   just copy and paste from AU_UAV_ROS
add the code to start collision avoidance (start method, loop in main)
	
	-do the same for coordinator and simulator

make new launch in AU_UAV_ROS, guiDrivenAPF.launch, that looks for col. av., coord, and sim in package AU_UAV_Team1


add WAYPOINT_THRESHOLD 30  to standarddefs.h


replace COLLISION_THRESHOLD with WAYPOINT_THRESHOLD in col. av. and coord.




add    /* Constants for converting latitude/longitude to meters */
	#define DELTA_LAT_TO_METERS 111200
	#define DELTA_LON_TO_METERS 93670
  to standardFuncs.h
